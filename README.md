# üß† Financial Forecasting with Seasonality Detection

A Python-based financial forecasting system that intelligently detects seasonal patterns and generates professional forecasts using advanced statistical methods and interactive visualizations.

## üåü Features

üîç Intelligent Seasonality Detection

- **Multiple Statistical Tests**: Autocorrelation, Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA, and Regression F-tests

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas numpy pygwalker scikit-learn scipy statsmodels openpyxl
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from financial_forecaster import ProfessionalFinancialForecaster

# Initialize the forecaster
forecaster = ProfessionalFinancialForecaster(
    'your_data.xlsx', 
    min_segment_length=5,           # Minimum quarters for trend segments
    seasonality_threshold=0.05      # Statistical significance threshold
)

# Run complete analysis
walker, viz_data, results = forecaster.run_professional_analysis()
```

### Data Format Requirements

Your Excel file should contain these columns:
- time: Date column (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Total Revenue: Revenue figures in millions
- Net Income: Net income figures in millions

Example:

| time  | Total Revenue | Net Income |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2020-01-01  | 91819  | 22236 |
| 2020-04-01  | 58313  | 11249 |
| 2020-07-01  | 64698  | 12673 |

## üìã Key Components

1. Seasonality Detection Engine
The system runs four statistical tests to determine if your data exhibits seasonal patterns:

```python
# Automatic seasonality detection
seasonality_detected = forecaster.detect_seasonality()

if seasonality_detected:
    print("‚úÖ Seasonality confirmed - using seasonal forecast")
else:
    print("‚ùå No seasonality - using trend-only forecast")
```

Statistical Tests Used:

- Autocorrelation Function (ACF): Tests correlation at 4-quarter lags
- Kruskal-Wallis Test: Non-parametric comparison of quarterly distributions
- One-way ANOVA: Parametric test for quarterly differences
- Regression F-test: Significance of quarter dummy variables

2. Advanced Trend Segmentation

```python
# Configure minimum segment length for conservative analysis
forecaster = ProfessionalFinancialForecaster(
    'data.xlsx', 
    min_segment_length=6  # Require 6+ quarters per trend segment
)
```

Changepoint Detection Methods:

- Rolling correlation analysis
- Piecewise regression with K-means clustering
- Statistical change detection (CUSUM-like)

3. Interactive Dashboard Creation

```python
# Launch professional PyGWalker dashboard
walker, viz_data, results = forecaster.run_professional_analysis()

# The dashboard opens automatically with:
# - Drag-and-drop chart creation
# - Professional export options
# - Real-time filtering and analysis
```

## üéØ Advanced Configuration

### Custom Seasonality Thresholds

```python
# Stricter seasonality detection (1% significance level)
forecaster = ProfessionalFinancialForecaster(
    'data.xlsx',
    seasonality_threshold=0.01
)

# More lenient detection (10% significance level)  
forecaster = ProfessionalFinancialForecaster(
    'data.xlsx',
    seasonality_threshold=0.10
)
```

### Conservative Trend Analysis

```python
# Require longer segments for more stable trends
forecaster = ProfessionalFinancialForecaster(
    'data.xlsx',
    min_segment_length=8  # 2+ years per segment
)
```
